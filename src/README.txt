App.py    That's the file that does the stuff. In python.

Config.py Might do something... I forget. I got it from the teacher's site.

lost_config.json  ... Same story as the Config.py


I'm sorry,  I ran out of time and was unable to do the last two steps. There is no Report Screen or asset_report.html.
EDIT: I don't know when that last line was from. I believe I have completed all of the steps now.
