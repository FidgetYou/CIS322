## This is not a finished project ##

So far I have been running app.py with Python from the command line.
(At this point though, there probably isn't any code to make a difference between command line and wsgi.)

app.py - This is the Python program in charge of stuff. Right now it just loads up the correct web page.

templates - This is a folder with the HTML files inside. There are five html files inside.
 
    login.html - This file should be the welcoming screen when the site is loaded.
  
    logout.html - This file should be the last screen you see. Unless you need to log back in.
  
    report_facility.html - This file would have had access to the database and brought up a
                           table of the assets or products at the facilities. 
                           If I had gotten that far.
                         
    report_filter.html - This file allows you to choose which of the other pages you would like to go to.
                         Either the logout page, or either of the two database report pages.
                      
    report_transit.html - This file would have had a table displaying output 
                          from the database based on what was in transit.
                          If I had gotten that far.
