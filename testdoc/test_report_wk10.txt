test plan followed by Alister Maguire. 




step 1:
    I created two users without any issues (using the web interface).


step 2:
    I logged into the system without issue. 


step 3:
    I added two facilities without issue. 


step 4:
    I added two assets without issue. 


step 5:
    
	part a) I ran into an error when I tried to make a transfer. It
            
		was an internal server error. The odd thing is that I 
            
		was able to transfer an item to its current location
            
		without this error coming up, but, if I tried to transfer
            
		an item to a different facility, the error would show up. 
            
		I looked in the error logs, and I believe this is the issue:
            
		"req_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M").isoformat(), 
             
		referer: http://localhost:8080/transfer_req
             
		AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'isoformat', 
             
		referer: http://localhost:8080/transfer_req"

    
	part b) I logged out and logged back in as a facilities officer, but
            
		the transfer (to the same location) didn't show up anywhere. 

    
	part c) I couldn't get this far.

step 6: I disposed of an asset without any issues. 



step 7: N/A
