This folder has a document in it. 

Hopefully it will help you learn how to test my project.

But the project isn't done.

And neither is the document.


As an update to the testdoc RyanColliersTestPlan-v2.pdf, I have gotten one of the reports working. 
The Asset Report should be working. I believe the other report was Extra Credit. 
(And was not mention in the CIS 322: Term Project Rubric) 
So, due to lack of time, that's all you get.
This update is here instead of in the actual PDF due to lack of time also. (Git doesn't want to let me edit PDFs.)
